# 🔌 Ports & Protocols in DevOps

## 🎯 What is a Port?

A **port** is like a door on a computer that allows communication with other devices. Each port is assigned a number (from 0 to 65535), and different services use different port numbers.

Think of your computer like an apartment building:
- The IP address is the building's address.
- The **port number** is the specific apartment number.

For example:
- Port **80** → Website using HTTP
- Port **22** → Remote login using SSH

## 📦 Common Ports in DevOps

| Port | Protocol | Use Case                         |
|------|----------|----------------------------------|
| 22   | SSH      | Secure shell for remote access   |
| 80   | HTTP     | Serving websites (insecure)      |
| 443  | HTTPS    | Secure websites                  |
| 3306 | MySQL    | Database communication           |
| 5432 | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL DB                   |
| 6379 | Redis    | In-memory key-value store        |
| 8080 | HTTP-Alt | Alternate HTTP (e.g., dev apps)  |
| 5000 | Custom   | Often used for local APIs        |
| 3000 | Custom   | Often used for front-end apps    |
| 27017| MongoDB  | MongoDB database                 |

## 🔁 TCP vs UDP – What’s the Difference?

| Feature          | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) | UDP (User Datagram Protocol) |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Connection-based | ✅ Yes                              | ❌ No                         |
| Reliability      | ✅ Guaranteed delivery               | ❌ Not guaranteed             |
| Speed            | 🐢 Slower (due to checks)            | 🚀 Faster (no checks)         |
| Use Case         | Web, SSH, FTP, Email                | Video calls, Gaming, Streaming |
| Error Checking   | ✅ Built-in                          | ⚠️ Basic or none              |

**Real-Life Analogy:**
- **TCP** = Registered mail (you get confirmation of delivery)
- **UDP** = Postcard (no confirmation, just sent)

## 🛠️ Why This Matters in DevOps?

- Configuring **firewalls** and **security groups** (e.g., in AWS, GCP)
- Running **containers** and **services** (port mapping in Docker/K8s)
- Debugging **network issues** and **connectivity errors**
- Creating **secure** systems (using correct protocols like HTTPS, SSH)

---

## ✅ Quick Recap

- A port is a numbered “door” to access services on a machine.
- DevOps tools and services use specific ports.
- TCP = reliable, UDP = faster.
- Knowing ports helps in configuring cloud resources, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

> 📌 Always open only the required ports. Block everything else for better security!

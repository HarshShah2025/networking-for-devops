# üåê What is Networking?

When two or more computers or devices connect via communication channels (cables or wireless) and share data, it's called a network. The Internet is the largest network, often called "the network of networks."

## üñß OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

The OSI model defines how data travels across a network through 7 layers, each with distinct roles:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Physical Layer  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Link Layer  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Network Layer  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Transport Layer  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Session Layer  
6Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation Layer  
7Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer

## üñß TCP/IP Model (Internet Protocol Suite)

A simplified 4-layer model used practically in modern networking:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer = (Application + Presentation + Session Layer of OSI)  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Transport Layer  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Internet Layer  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Network Access Layer (Data Link + Physical Layer of OSI)

## üìù Key Networking Concepts:

- **IP (Internet Protocol):** Assigns unique addresses to devices for communication across networks.
- **MAC Address (Media Access Control):** Hardware-based unique identifier for devices on a local network.
- **Router:** Connects different networks and directs data packets between them.
- **Switch:** Connects multiple devices in a local network and directs traffic using MAC addresses.
- **Firewall:** Monitors and controls network traffic based on security rules.
